This version of 5G-SDN testbed demo was possible by merging open-source projects: 

- [OpenvSwitch](https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs "OpenvSwitch")

- [Opendaylight](https://github.com/opendaylight/controller "Opendaylight")

- [Open5Gs](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs "Open5Gs")

# Design Open-Source SDN-based 5G Standalone Testbed #

## Project Description ##
This project focuses on implementing Standalone (SA) mode in 5G Networks using SDN and NFV. We have utilized various open-source projects, including Open5Gs, srsRAN, UERANSIM, Opendaylight (ODL), and OpenvSwitch (OVS), to build and deploy our testbed. We wil provide a comprehensive instructions to replicate our deployed testbed. 

## Getting started ##
This project consists of several steps based on building several projects to deploy a 5G-SDN testbed, which are the following: 

1. Setup SDN environment
2. Deploy and Configure Open5Gs
3. Deploy and Configure UERANSIM 
4. Deploy and Configure srsRAN (ZeroMQ) 
5. Testbed Capabilities Demo
