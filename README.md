srsRAN

Design Open-Source SDN-based 5G Standalone Testbed
Project Description
This project focuses on implementing Standalone (SA) mode in 5G Networks using SDN and NFV. We have utilized various open-source projects, including Open5Gs, srsRAN, UERANSIM, Opendaylight (ODL), and OpenvSwitch (OVS), to build and deploy our testbed. We wil provide a comprehensive instructions to replicate our deployed testbed.

Getting started
This project consists of several steps based on building several projects to deploy a 5G-SDN testbed, which are the following:

Setup SDN environment
Deploy and Configure Open5Gs
Deploy and Configure UERANSIM
Deploy and Configure srsRAN (ZeroMQ)
Testbed Capabilities Demo
